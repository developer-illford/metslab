                    Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless,
                    odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the main constituent
                    of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. It exists in gaseous, liquid,
                    and solid states and it freezing at 32°F or 0°C and boiling at 212°F or 100°C, that in a more or
                    less impure state constitutes rain, oceans, lakes, rivers, etc. which makes it invaluable for human
                    uses and as plant and animal habitat. Since water is readily changed to a vapour (gas), it can
                    travel through the atmosphere from the oceans inland, where it condenses and nourishes life.

            Drinking Water Testing

        <img src="img/water_testing/Rectangle 114.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            Drinking Water and fresh air are the unavoidable reasons for life. More than 70% of human body is composed
            by water. But unfortunately, only 3% of water available across the globe is fresh water and only half of
            that is available to humans. In developing countries population growth combined with industrial development
            is hard pressing on water demand resulting in the shrinkage of water table. <br>
            The shrinkage water table, bad industrial waste management practices, improper sanitation are mostly
            responsible for the deteriorating drinking water quality. The most essential requirement to ensure good
            quality drinking availability to all is regular drinking water testing.

        <p>
            Non-potable water is water that is not of drinking quality, but may still be used for many other purposes,
            depending on its quality. Potable water is water of a quality suitable for drinking, cooking and personal
            bathing. The standards that define potable water are described in the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.
            Unless water is known to be of potable quality it should be regarded as non-potable and used appropriately.

            While doing waste water testing, treatment of wastewater by a physical and/or chemical process involving
            settlement of suspended solids, or other process in which the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) of the incoming
            wastewater is reduced by at least 20% before discharge, and the total suspended solids content is reduced by
            at least 50%.

            Sea Water Testing

        <p>
            Sea Water Analysis Services include sampling of the seawater column, sediment recovery and
            detailed analysis of water, sediment and fish tissue for trace heavy metals and organics for various
            chemicals and metals.
            There are three main water quality parameters to measure the quality of water: physical, chemical, and
            biological. Physical water quality parameters include eight principle indicators: electrical conductivity,
            salinity, total dissolved solids, turbidity, temperature, color, and taste and odor. Chemical water
            parameters include pH, acidity, alkalinity, hardness, chlorine, and dissolved oxygen. The final water
            quality is biological, which includes bacteria, algae, nutrients, and viruses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Physical Parameters
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical water quality parameters are observed as a result of physical changes in the water.
        </p>

        <h5>Electrical Conductivity (EC)</h5>
        <p>Conductivity is a core physical water parameter. Electrical conductivity (EC) refers to the ability of water
            to conduct an electrical current in water over a certain distance, usually measured in Siemens (S) per
            distance. The power for water to conduct electricity comes from the concentration of ions within the water.
            Electrical conductivity is essential to measure when assessing the quality of water because it can detect
            the level of contaminated water. Water that has a high EC has a greater amount of contaminants, whereas
            water that has good water quality such as drinking water has fewer contaminants, and therefore cannot
            conduct electricity.</p>

        <h5>Total Dissolved Solids</h5>
        <p>Total dissolved solids (TDS) enter the water from sewage, agricultural runoff, industrial wastewater, or the
            use of water treatment chemicals. The more TDS that are suspended or in suspension in water, the higher the
            water's conductivity, TDS meter is the easiest way to measure TDS levels in the water.</p>

        <h5>Turbidity</h5>
        <p>Turbidity refers to the haziness of water. High turbid conditions are caused by suspended solids or tiny
            particles; when the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) and TDS in the water increase, the
            turbidity also increases.</p>

        <h5>Temperature</h5>
        <p>Temperature measures the kinetic energy of molecules in the water, measured in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius.
            Temperature is one of the most essential parameters of water quality, as it influences biological activity
            and growth in water, plus it has a direct effect on the water chemistry, influencing the other main water
            quality parameters. A temperature sensor is the easiest way to monitor the temperature. Temperature sensors
            (Thermometer) are devices used in our everyday lives to measure the temperature in a wide range of
            industries and applications. Temperature sensors provide readable measurements from electrical signals
            inside the temperature sensor. When a temperature change is detected, an electrical voltage or resistance is
            generated across the diode terminals inside the temperature probe.</p>

        <h5>Color</h5>
        <p>The colors of water indicate the presence of a range of chemical and organic pollutants such as copper from
            plumbing systems, rust from iron pipes, algae, bacteria, and so on. Water that is used in the home should
            appear colorless. If tap water is blue or green, it is an indication of foreign substances such as
            microscopic organisms and particles. Decaying organic matter can also change the color of water, and this is
            commonly seen in stagnant pools of water like swamps. Testing the color of the water is easy, as it can be
            done with the naked eye. All that is needed is a series of slides or tubes to compare a water sample. There
            are many color card tests available for both home use and industrial applications. For high-accuracy color
            measurements, a tintometer (a type of color sensor) is used.</p>

        <h5>Taste & Odor</h5>
        <p>The last physical water quality parameters are taste and odor. They go hand in hand, as usually when the
            taste of water changes, an odor is produced. This is typically from a foreign substance in the water. These
            are usually organic materials and inorganic compounds.</p>

        <h5>Chemical Parameters</h5>
        <p>Chemical water quality parameters assess the chemical characteristics of the water.</p>

        <h5>PH Testing</h5>
        <p>Measures the acidity and alkalinity of water. One of the most important chemical water quality parameters is
            pH, and it should always be the first measurement when assessing the quality of water. Elevated pH levels
            can lead to bitter-tasting water. High pH also causes water pipes and other industrial appliances to become
            encrusted with deposits, corroding materials, and therefore, increasing toxicity levels in the water. Most
            aquatic organisms are only able to survive within a pH range of 6 to 8. There are many ways to measure the
            pH of water. The simplest way is with a pH paper test kit. However, we always recommend a pH sensor with a
            pH probe for high accuracy and reliable results. A pH sensor is also the quickest way to see if water is
            acidic or alkaline.</p>

        <h5>Acidity</h5>
        <p>Acidity measures the level of acid in the water, measured by a pH probe/sensor. Acidic water is caused by
            dissolved inorganic acids, carbon dioxide, and hydrolytic salts. Acidic water can affect biological activity
            in water and increase corrosion from chemical reactions.</p>

        <h5>Alkalinity</h5>
        <p>Acidity indicates how well water can neutralize acids, measured using a pH sensor. Alkalinity is important
            for measuring water quality, as it determines how much soda ash is needed to neutralize the water. Water
            becomes alkaline when bicarbonate, hydroxide, and carbonate ions dissolve in water. Water that has a very
            high alkalinity level indicates contamination.</p>

        <h5>Water Hardness</h5>
        <p>Water hardness refers to the mineral content of water. If water is considered hard, calcium or magnesium are
            likely the cause. Naturally, groundwater has a greater water hardness than surface water because groundwater
            is more exposed to minerals and ions. Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of
            limestone, chalk, or gypsum, which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates, bicarbonates,
            and sulfates. Hard drinking water may have moderate health benefits, but can pose critical problems in
            industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in boilers, cooling
            towers, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a
            lack of foam formation when soap is agitated in water, and by the formation of limescale in kettles and
            water heaters. Wherever water hardness is a concern, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water's
            adverse effects. If hard water is left untreated, it can scale pipe systems and make it difficult to bathe.
            Water hardness may be due to the presence of elements like iron.</p>

        <h5>Iron</h5>
        <p>Water containing ferrous iron is clear and colorless because the iron is completely dissolved. When exposed
            to air in the pressure tank or atmosphere, the water turns cloudy and a reddish-brown substance begins to
            form. This sediment is the oxidized or ferric form of iron that will not dissolve in water.</p>

        <h5>Fluoride</h5>
        <p>Fluorine is a common element that does not occur in the elemental state in nature because of its high
            reactivity. It accounts for about 0.3 g/kg of the Earth's crust and exists in the form of fluorides in a
            number of minerals, of which fluorspar, cryolite, and fluorapatite are the most common. The oxidation state
            of the fluoride ion is -1. Fluoride is usually determined by means of an ion-selective electrode, which
            makes it possible to measure the total amount of free and complex-bound fluoride dissolved in water.</p>

        <h5>Phenols</h5>
        <p>Phenol is an organic compound appreciably soluble in water, with about 84.2 g dissolving in 1000 mL (0.895
            M). Homogeneous mixtures of phenol and water at phenol-to-water mass ratios of 2.6 and higher are possible.
            The sodium salt of phenol, sodium phenoxide, is far more water-soluble.</p>

        <h5>Cyanide</h5>
        <p>Some cyanide in water will be transformed into less harmful chemicals by microorganisms or will form a
            complex with metals, such as iron. The half-life of cyanide in water is not known. Cyanide in water does not
            build up in the bodies of fish. Cyanides are fairly mobile in soil.</p>

        <h5>Heavy Metals</h5>
        <p>Metals are introduced in aquatic systems as a result of the weathering of soils and rocks, from volcanic
            eruptions, and from a variety of human activities involving the mining, processing, or use of metals and/or
            substances that contain metal pollutants. The most common heavy metal pollutants are arsenic, cadmium,
            chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and mercury. There are different types of sources of pollutants: point
            sources (localized pollution), where pollutants come from single, identifiable sources. The second type of
            pollutant sources are nonpoint sources, where pollutants come from dispersed (and often difficult to
            identify) sources. There are only a few examples of localized metal pollution, like the natural weathering
            of ore bodies and the little metal particles coming from coal-burning power plants via smokestacks in air,
            water, and soils around the factory.</p>
        <h5>Metals</h5>
        <p>Testing that indicates the presence of a suite of metals which are not naturally occurring in water. Heavy
            metals (Aluminium, Antimony, Arsenic, Beryllium, Bismuth, Copper, Cadmium, Lead, Mercury, Nickel, Uranium,
            Tin, Vanadium, and Zinc) can find their way into water bodies through natural processes or human activities
            such as mining, processing of minerals, use of metals as containers, and transportation through metallic
            pipelines. Heavy metals are known to harm kidneys, liver, nervous system, and bone structure.</p>
        <p>Lead poisoning in humans can cause problems in the synthesis of hemoglobin, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract,
            joints, and reproductive systems and can cause acute or chronic damage to the nervous system. Lead can also
            cause osteoporosis and weaken bones because it starts replacing Calcium in the bones.</p>
        <p>Long-term exposure to cadmium leads to renal dysfunction. High exposure can lead to lung cancer and
            osteodystrophy. Nickel has numerous reported mechanisms of toxicity, including redox cycling and inhibition
            of DNA repair, as well as exhibiting allergic effects.</p>
        <p>Exposure to mercury can lead to tremors, gingivitis, and other psychological changes with spontaneous
            absorption and congenital malformation. Mono methyl mercury causes damage to the brain and the central
            nervous system, congenital malformations, and developmental changes in young children. Vanadium has toxic
            effects on the liver, kidney, nervous and cardiovascular systems, and blood-forming organs.</p>

            <li>Cadmium</li>
        </ul>



        <h5>Dissolved Oxygen</h5>
        <p>Dissolved oxygen (DO) refers to the amount of oxygen dissolved in water. Dissolved oxygen gets into water
            from direct atmospheric absorption, a byproduct of plant photosynthesis, and from groundwater discharge.
            Dissolved oxygen is one of the most significant indicators of water quality in water treatment systems and
            aquariums, and therefore, it is a crucial water quality parameter to monitor because it determines if water
            is polluted. If oxygen levels dramatically drop in aquatic environments, aquatic organisms cannot survive.
            Dissolved oxygen is measured using an electrochemical DO meter and probe or the Winkler method.</p>

        <h5>Biological Parameters</h5>
        <p>Biological water quality parameters look at the characteristics to describe the presence or absence of
            waterborne pathogens and other microbial organisms. These include the following microbes:</p>

        <h5>Bacteria</h5>
        <p>Bacterial content tells us a lot about water quality. Bacteria are small, single-celled organisms that can
            rapidly reproduce if the pH level and temperature of the water allow. Unfortunately, as bacteria multiply at
            such a rapid rate, they are almost impossible to measure. Yet, what we do know, is that bacteria reproduce
            at a much slower pace in colder environments and areas that lack nutrients. Examples include Coliform,
            Streptococci (Faecal), Enterococci, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
            Campylobacter, and Clostridium perfringens.</p>

        <h5>Algae</h5>
        <p>Algae are microscopic aquatic plants containing chlorophyll (photosynthetic pigments). They feed off
            inorganic material, converting it into organic material via photosynthesis. Algae can indicate poor water
            quality, and many algal indicators are used in water systems to assess environmental conditions. Algal
            blooms are indicators of bad odors and poor taste in water.</p>

        <h5>Viruses</h5>
        <p>Viruses are a prime cause of human waterborne and water-related diseases. Testing for viruses in the water
            tells us a lot about the quality of water, and if the water needs treatment before use. Testing for viruses
            requires powerful electron microscopes or PCR testing methods. PCR methods are preferred because they can
            rapidly detect all the virus groups that cause waterborne diseases. Despite the difficulty in testing and
            treating viruses in water, they are usually removed during water purification and disinfection processes.
        </p>

        <h5>Chloride Test</h5>
        <p>Chloride is usually present in fresh and saltwater. However, its levels can be exacerbated as a result of
            minerals dissolving and industrial pollution.</p>

        <h5>Total Suspended Solids</h5>
        <p>Total Suspended Solids (TSS) is a measurement of the total solids in a water or wastewater sample that are
            retained by filtration. TSS is an important water quality parameter measure for wastewater treatment
            operations and environmental health. Wastewater contains large quantities of suspended organic and inorganic
            material that must be removed through screening, filtration, or settling/flotation methods prior to
            environmental discharge. TSS will also have adverse effects on UV disinfection, blocking/scattering UV light
            bound for pathogen disinfection, or alternatively requiring higher intensity for proper disinfection,
            increasing energy costs.</p>

        <h5>Test for Pesticides</h5>
        <p>The extensive use of pesticides harms the soil, air, food surface, and ground waters, causing serious impacts
            on the environment and human health. In natural waters, pesticide residues are present at very low levels
            and can be degraded when submitted to lower pH levels or exposed to solar radiation. The presence of organic
            contaminants in the environment results from pollution from various anthropogenic activities. While testing
            for pesticides, the presence of pesticides generated by the intensification of agriculture is regarded as
            some of the most dangerous contaminants of the environment. Pesticides in environmental samples are analyzed
            by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) using isotope dilution
            and internal standard quantitation techniques.</p>

        <h5>Volatile Organic Compounds</h5>
        <p>Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs, are a class or group of organic chemicals that contain carbon and tend
            to volatilize or evaporate into the atmosphere, such as benzene and toluene. VOCs can have a variety of
            harmful health effects. The risk to human health is a function of the exposure route, level of exposure, and
            length of the exposure. Exposure to low levels of certain VOCs over long periods may impair immune system
            function, damage the liver, or increase the risk of cancer. At high levels, many VOCs can cause central
            nervous system depression (drowsiness, stupor). Short-term exposure can cause irritation to the skin or
            mucous membranes if inhaled.</p>

        <h5>Chemical Oxygen Demand</h5>
        <p>Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is a measure of water and wastewater quality. The COD test is often used to
            monitor drinking water testing plant efficiency. This test is based on the fact that a strong oxidizing
            agent, under acidic conditions, can fully oxidize almost any organic compound to carbon dioxide. The COD is
            the amount of oxygen consumed to chemically oxidize organic water contaminants to inorganic end products.
        </p>

        <h5>Nitrate and Phosphate Test</h5>
        <p>The presence of these essential nutrients is a good indicator of strong plant life. However, the addition of
            artificial nitrates and phosphates through detergents, fertilizers, or sewage can be harmful and result in
            eutrophication, generally in the form of unwanted algal blooms.</p>

        <h5>Redox Reactions</h5>
        <p>The measurement of the reduction-oxidization potential of a solution, which indicates electron activity,
            plays a crucial role as microorganism growth is highly dependent on these levels.</p>

        <h5>Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH)</h5>
        <p>Petroleum products occur as complex mixtures of chemicals, primarily hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are organic
            compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms arranged in varying structural configurations. Most
            petroleum hydrocarbon mixtures contain very low concentrations of PAHs. A major concern regarding PAHs is
            the potential carcinogenicity of some molecules. Benzo(a)pyrene and benz(a)anthracene are classified as
            probable human carcinogens.</p>

        <h5>Poly Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)</h5>
        <p>PCBs are a group of man-made organic chemicals consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine atoms. The number
            of chlorine atoms and their location in a PCB molecule determine many of its physical and chemical
            properties. PCBs have no known taste or smell and range in consistency from an oil to a waxy solid. PCBs are
            a health hazard, especially to children. Consuming water with high levels of PCBs over time can cause health
            effects such as acne and rashes, liver and kidney dysfunction, depression and fatigue, nose and lung
            irritation, increased risk of cancer, and developmental problems in children.</p>

        <h5>Other Parameters</h5>
        <p>Other parameters include monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
            including benzo(a)pyrene.</p>
