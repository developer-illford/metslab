                        substances
                        including lead and phthalates and toxic materials to secure children's health.</li>
                    <li>Mechanical and Structural Integrity: Testing ensures that components like puzzle pieces or
                        playground
                        equipment parts are free from sharp edges, small detachable parts, or other hazards that could
                        pose a
                        risk to children.</li>
                    <li>UV and Weather Resistance: For outdoor recreational items like inflatable pools, tests are
                        performed to
                        verify that they can endure prolonged sun exposure without fading, tearing, or weakening.</li>

                <p>Plastic components in sporting goods, including helmets, shoes, water bottles, exercise mats and
                    sports
                    equipment, undergo specialized testing for safety and performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact Protection: The evaluation process for protective equipment like helmets consists of
                        rigorous
                        testing because it enables proper protection in cases of cycling accidents and contact sport
                        activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wearability and Comfort: Athletic shoes and exercise mats are tested for comfort, flexibility

                        injury.</li>
                    <li>Strength and Durability: Plastic parts in sports equipment, like rackets and balls, are tested
                        for their
                        ability to endure repeated use and perform at high standards in demanding conditions.</li>

                    are
                    rigorously tested for strength, aesthetic appeal and stability:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Load-Bearing Capacity: Testing of furniture products such as tables and chairs follows
                        procedures that
                        verify their capacity to keep heavy weight loads while staying stable and unbroken.</li>
                    <li>UV and Weather Resistance: Outdoor plastic furniture requires testing for its UV resistance to
                        protect
                        against discoloration along with material breakdown from sunlight.</li>

                        resistance and
                        discoloration while inspecting overall physical deterioration for preservation of aesthetic
