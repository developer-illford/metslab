                The base material, chemical structure, chemical composition and physicochemical properties can
                significantly impact the polymer's function. For example, polymeric functional membrane materials
                require the polymer to have a microporous structure or a diffusion function to meet the selective
                permeation requirement of the separated material in the membrane. The reactive functional polymer needs
                to have a certain swelling property or a range of porosity and pore size distribution to satisfy the
                diffusion of the reaction substance therein. Other functional polymer materials have certain
                requirements for polymer chemistry properties, mechanical properties and thermal stability. Our polymer

            </div>
            <p>
                The mechanical characteristics of polymers serve as the foundation for a number of exceptional physical
                attributes and are the primary determinants of the sensible use of polymer materials. With polymer's
                prevalent applications, it is urgent to understand and master the general laws and characteristics of
                the mechanical properties of polymers and their relationships with the structure, so as to correctly
                control the processing conditions and properly obtain the required polymer materials. For example, the
                polymer must withstand the tensile force when used as a fiber; it must withstand the tapping when used
                as a plastic product; and it must possess elasticity and wear resistance when used as a rubber. Our

                Thermal Analysis
            </div>
            <p>
                With the development of the polymer synthesis industry and the expansion of polymer application fields,
                more requirements have been proposed for the types and properties of polymer materials. In order to
                develop new types of high polymers and control their quality and performance, it is essential to
                determine the melting temperature (Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg), composition of the mixture
                and copolymer, thermal history, and crystallinity of the polymer. To obtain these parameter values,
                thermal analysis is the main analytical tool. A group of methods known as thermal analysis are used to
                measure the characteristics of samples under program-controlled temperature fluctuations or over time.
                Our thermal analyses cover,

                Polymer Structure & Morphology Analysis
            </div>
            <p>
                The study of polymer morphology represents an interdisciplinary approach from the Nano level (e.g.,
                polymer structure, conformation, and crystallinity) to the macrolevel (e.g., surface morphology of final
                products, fibers, foils, blends, and composites). It means that the structural analysis of polymer can
                be divided into two types: microstructure morphology and macrostructure morphology. The microstructure
                of a polymer is related to the physical arrangement of monomer residues along the backbone of the chain
                and it determines its macroscopic physical and mechanical properties, such as the crystallinity, the
                glass transition temperature, or microphase separation phenomenon. On the other hand, the macrostructure
                morphology is related to the interactions between the polymer chains. Both features are very essential
                and useful, playing a major role in determining the physical and chemical properties of a polymer. Our,

                    five fundamental aspects.Our testing system begins with mechanical property analysis as we execute
                    complex tests that assess material strength properties. The testing process includes exact tensile
                    strength recording through modern dynamometers along with multi-point impact assessment and complete
                    flexibility evaluation and extensive hardness tests at different measurement levels. The analysis
                    depends upon thermal characterization which uses advanced calorimetry and thermal analysis systems.
                    The analysis includes heat deflection temperature testing along with precise melting point
                    determination and advanced international standard flammability assessments and thermal conductivity
