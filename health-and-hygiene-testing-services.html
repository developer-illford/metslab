                <p>
                    At our testing facilities, we maintain strict adherence to a comprehensive framework of
                    international,
                    European, and UK standards that govern health and hygiene products. Our testing protocols align with
                    the
                    Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), ensuring products meet
                    the
                    stringent requirements for safety and performance. We conduct thorough evaluations following EN
                    14683 for
                    medical face masks, verifying bacterial filtration efficiency, differential pressure, and splash
                    resistance.
                    For medical gloves and protective equipment, we implement the EN 455 series standards, encompassing
                    requirements for freedom from holes, dimensions, and biological safety evaluation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our laboratories are accredited under ISO/IEC 17025:2017, demonstrating our technical competence and
                    ability
                    to produce precise, accurate test data. We integrate ISO 13485:2016 principles into our quality
                    management
                    system, specifically tailored for medical devices and related services. The biocompatibility of
                    materials is
                    assessed through the EN ISO 10993 series, including cytotoxicity, sensitization, and irritation
                    testing. For
                    sterilization validation, we follow EN ISO 11137 for radiation sterilization and EN ISO 11135 for
                    ethylene
                    oxide sterilization processes.

                <p>
                    In compliance with UK regulations, we implement the UK MDR 2002 requirements and MHRA guidelines,
                    ensuring
                    products meet post-Brexit British conformity standards. Our testing protocols incorporate British
                    Standards
                    Institution (BSI) specifications and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles. For chemical
                    disinfectants
                    and antiseptics, we follow EN 14476 and EN 13727, evaluating antimicrobial efficacy under practical
                    conditions. Packaging integrity testing adheres to EN ISO 11607, ensuring sterile barrier systems
                    maintain
                    product safety throughout their lifecycle.
