                    The testing methodologies we use in agricultural quality assurance enter the highest tiers of
                    international and European standards. We operate with full UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation
                    Service) accreditation to conduct tests for UK agricultural requirements using standards prescribed
                    in the Fertilizers Manual (RB209) published by DEFRA. Our analysis procedures at the laboratories
                    abide by BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 testing and calibration laboratory standards to yield results of
                    superior technical competence and reliability.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Our testing procedures include adherence to the EU Fertilizing Products Regulation 2019/1009 which
                    defines specific safety and efficacy standards for fertilizers alongside European standards across
                    our entire testing framework. Our testing procedures confirm adherence to major accident hazard
                    regulations for COMAH and the English and Welsh water, soil, and air protection requirements of the
                    Code of Good Agricultural Practice in Agro-Products & Fertilizer Testing Services in the UK. The
                    multi-step evaluation system enables products to maintain safety requirements together with
                    performance criteria when entering foreign markets.

                <p>Our testing services implement a complete evaluation system to analyze various essential aspects of
                    agricultural products during assessments. The first step of our analysis includes performing
                    detailed nutrient composition tests through spectroscopic and chromatographic methods to measure all
                    major as well as minor nutrients accurately. The evaluation process measures nutrient availability
                    and specific solubility patterns and release behaviors when products interact under different
                    environmental conditions. A complete contamination check exists in our testing methods to screen
                    products using heavy metal testing and organic pollutant assessment and probing for dangerous
                    substances that threaten both soil well-being and crop security.
                </p>
                <p>Physical and chemical characterization remains a fundamental component that should be included when
                    applying our testing criteria. Granular product properties include particle size distribution tests
                    and an assessment of crushing strength and flowability that determines operational performance. We
                    evaluate liquid fertilizers through tests that check their stability and measurement of
                    precipitation behavior and their performance within typical application equipment. To evaluate
                    organic products we perform dedicated tests which evaluate biological functioning as well as product
                    maturation together with dangers of toxicity to plants. Each specific test method ensures the
                    delivery of relevant data which helps developers optimize products.

                <p>The firm relies on agricultural scientists and analytical experts with extensive experience who
                    support its technical capabilities in every evaluation process. The testing facilities at our labs
                    utilize advanced analytical instruments comprising ICP as well as HPLC and various molecular
                    spectroscopy equipment. The excellent technical capabilities of our organization benefit from our
                    quick analysis times combined with extensive technical assistance provided to our customers. The

                <ul class="ul_step1">
                    <li>Micronutrient Fertilizers: Micronutrients are essential in smaller quantities but are critical

                <div class="main-title">The following parameters are used to analyze the fertilizers:</div>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Analysis of Heavy Metals and Trace Elements in Fertilizers,</strong> It is crucial to
                    identify heavy metals
                    and trace elements in fertilizers. A sufficient supply of vital trace elements like copper and zinc,
                    as well as plant nutrients like potassium and phosphorus, are necessary for high crop yields. To
                    prevent buildup in soil and their entry into the food chain, heavy metals like lead (Pb), cadmium
                    (Cd), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), uranium (U), and cesium (Cs) must be kept at low concentrations.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Total amounts of potassium (K2O), </strong>phosphate (P2O5), and nitrogen (N): Generally
                    speaking, an NPK ratio of 4:2:1 (N: P2O5:K2O) is desirable and approved for macro-level monitoring
                    of plant nutrient consumption for the entire nation.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Determination of Formaldehyde Content: </strong>When urea-formaldehyde fertilizer is sprayed
                    on crops, formaldehyde is released. The findings explain the elevated levels of formaldehyde in
                    agricultural regions. Tropospheric formaldehyde can be locally influenced by Agro-Products &
                    Fertilizer Testing Services in the UK.</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis of Chelated Micronutrients: </strong>Chelated micronutrients are fertilizers in
                    which a bigger molecule known as a ligand or chelator surrounds the micronutrient ion (Fe, Mn, Zn,
                    Cu, Co, etc.). Ligands can be manufactured or natural substances. A chelated micronutrient is
                    created when these substances are mixed with a micronutrient. We at METS are also able to offer
                    analytical services in the field in which we are interested.</p>
