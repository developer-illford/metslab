                    The survival of every human depends on food so it becomes critical to maintain both safety and
                    contamination-free food in tours. Food testing involves laboratory evaluation of food samples to
                    detect and measure dangerous pollutants and harmful agents, including bacteria, along with viruses,
                    chemicals, and other dangerous substances. Food Analysis Services in the UK exist to guarantee that
                    the food items maintain their safety along with their lack of harmful contaminants.

                <p>
                    Tests of food products play an essential role in protecting their safety alongside maintaining their
                    quality standards. Quality testing identifies harmful substances in food that trigger illnesses and
                    allergies together with other health issues in people. Testing functions as the main safeguard of
                    public confidence while ensuring food safety in the modern global food market context. The
                    examination process guides authorities towards discovering contaminated sources so they can apply
                    preventive steps against contamination. Food testing procedures verify that food products fulfil
                    both government requirements and industry mandatory standards. Food industry operators together with
                    consumers need food testing as an essential practice. Food testing enables both consumer trust in
                    food products as well as safety assessment to ensure the products are suitable for consumption.

                    The test procedures of METS provide complete verification of nutritional elements alongside
                    authenticity assessment which meets regulatory standards. The diverse testing strategies create
                    organizations that protect themselves from legal risks while earning public trust in addition to
                    delivering products beyond customer expectations

                    Wales and Northern Ireland’s public health agency, and industry to ensure effective policy response
                    and implementation. These guidelines provide information on the bacteria that cause foodborne
                    disease and those that act as hygiene indicators, on interpretation of test results, comments on
                    poor practices that are probably caused by unfavourable outcomes and recommend suitable public
                    health measures. These guidelines have been expanded to include information on statutory
                    requirements such as for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) testing as well as advice on
                    sampling, transport and test selection.

                    the Regulation on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs, Regulation (EC) 852/2004 as amended (3), and the
                    General Food Law Regulation (EC) 178/2002 as amended (45). In addition, the regulation laying down
                    specific rules for food of animal origin Regulation (EC) 853/2004 as amended (46) contains
                    microbiological criteria for live bivalve molluscs, and raw milk is regulated by the Food Safety and
                    Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013 (47).

            <h5 class="section-title">Food Standards Act 1999 & Food Standards Agency (FSA) in UK:</h5>
            <p>Food Analysis Services in the UK are of the utmost importance, for organisations and businesses that deal
                with the handling or preparation of foods, ensuring that you are complying with food safety laws is a
                major concern. The Food Standards Act 1999 was created to provide the U.K. Food Standards Agency with
                powers and authority to execute actions by the food regulations outlined by the government and
                independent food safety organisations. This grants them access to any stage of the supply and food
                production chain, which means that people can trust that the food they buy and eat is safe and
                trustworthy.
            </p>
            <p>The main goal of the Food Standards Act 1999 is to allow for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to protect
                the health and safety of the public in the production, preparation, and consumption of food. It gives
                the FSA the authority and rights to protect the public’s health in any instance where it feels that food
                safety standards are not up to par or are not following regulations.
            </p>
            <p>In line with the Food Standards Act 1999, food businesses must ensure that they comply with the food
                safety legislation by;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring that they do not include or remove anything from food or treat food in any way that means
                    it would be damaging to the health of people eating it</li>
                <li>Ensuring that served or sold is of the nature, substance or quality that consumers would expect</li>
                <li>Ensuring that the food is labelled, advertised, and presented in a way that is not false or
                    misleading</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, the Food Standards Act 1999 is another key piece of UK legislation that helps to protect the public
                health of those living in the UK about food. Without its being in effect, the FSA would not have the
                power it does in our current day and age to behave in a way that is best aligned with consumer
                interests.
            </p>
            <p>METS-UK offer you an insight into what the Food Standards Act 1999 is, as well as the FSA’s role in
                relation to this legislation and how this complies with your food products.</p>
            <h5 class="section-title">Packaging and Labelling -Legal Requirements: </h5>
            <p>The food labels show us the information about the food products contained. Most packaged food items are
                required to have a label with this information, but the information required depends on the food type.
                What information must be included and how it must be presented are specified under the UK's current food
                labelling rules. Food labels ought to be readable, unambiguous, and truthful. However, food supplements
                and natural mineral waters are exempt from the nutrition labelling regulations.
            </p>
            <p>In a single piece of legislation, the Food Information to Consumers (FIC) Regulation 1169/2011 on the
                provision of food information to consumers unifies EU regulations on nutrition labelling and general
                food labelling.
            </p>
            <p>Labelling of Prepacked Food: All prepacked food requires food labels that display certain mandatory
                information. All food products are subject to general food labelling requirements and any labelling
                provided must be accurate and not misleading. The following foods are subject to product-specific
                regulations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cocoa and chocolate products</li>
                <li>Soluble coffee</li>
                <li>Milk and milk products</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>Infant formula</li>
                <li>Meat & meat products</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="section-title">What must be included in the labelling?</div>
            <p>Food labels and packaging are required by law to include the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name of the food:</strong> The name of the food must be clearly stated on the packaging and
                    not be misleading. If the law specifies a name, it must be used. A customary name may be used if
                    there isn't a legal one.</li>
                <li><strong>List of ingredients:</strong> If a food product has two or more ingredients, then all must
                    be listed under the heading 'Ingredients' or a suitable heading which includes the word
                    'ingredients'. Ingredients must be stated by weight, starting with the primary component based on
                    the quantity required to prepare the dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Allergen information:</strong> When a food product contains any of the 14 allergens required
                    to be declared by law as ingredients, these allergens must be listed and emphasized within the
                    ingredients list.</li>
                <li><strong>Net quantity:</strong> All packaged foods above 5g or 5ml must show the net quantity on the
                    label to comply with the Food Information Regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage conditions and date labelling:</strong> Food labels must be marked with either a
                    ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date so that it is clear how long foods can be kept and how to store them.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Name and address of manufacturer:</strong> Food businesses must include a business name and
                    address on the packaging or food label. This needs to be either the address of the company that
                    imported the food or the name of the company that markets it.</li>
                <li><strong>Country of origin:</strong> According to the FIC Regulations, it is required to suggest the
                    country of origin or place of provenance of food where doing otherwise could cause the consumer to
                    be misinformed about the actual country of origin or place of provenance of the food.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation instructions:</strong> Instructions on how to prepare and cook the food
                    appropriately, including for heating in a microwave oven, must be given on the label if they are
                    needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Declaration:</strong> The mandatory nutritional declaration must be presented in
                    a specific format and give values for energy and six nutrients. The values must be given in the
                    units (including both kJ and kcal for energy) per 100g/ml, and the nutrition declaration must meet
                    the minimum font size requirement.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pesticide Residues:</strong> The incorrect application or overuse of pesticides on
                    agricultural produce and in the vicinity of animals can lead to pesticide residues in food. Overuse
                    or use of agrichemicals close to harvest can lead to excessive residue on agricultural produce. The
                    analysis includes the application of multi-pesticide residue methods by both GC-MS/MS and LC-MS, to
                    analyze for more than 500 pesticide constituents.</li>
                <li><strong>Dioxins & Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs):</strong> Dioxins are referred to as
                    persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Among the commonly known POPs are PCBs, DDT, and dioxins. POPs
                    encompass a variety of compounds that are globally produced chemicals in agriculture, disease
                    control, industry, or manufacturing.</li>
                <li><strong>Food Mycotoxins:</strong> Mycotoxins are poisonous substances which are naturally
                    synthesized by specific species of moulds (fungi). Molds that can form mycotoxins develop on many
                    food items like cereals, dried fruits, nuts, and spices. The Food and Agriculture Organization of
                    the United Nations (FAO) estimates that approximately 25 per cent of global food production includes
                    mycotoxins. The most frequent mycotoxins causing concern to livestock and human health are
                    aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, fumonisins, zearalenone, and nivalenol/deoxynivalenol.</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy Metals:</strong> The presence of heavy metals in foods is a timely issue, involving
                    contamination of the food chain and harm to public health. Contamination of foods by heavy metals
                    has several different sources. The most important ones include residual mud, chemical fertilisers
                    and pesticides used in agriculture, contamination of the soil used to produce food, and the usage of
                    other materials, among others. Heavy metal contamination can come from a variety of sources,
                    including both plant-based items (such as cereals, rice, wheat, edible roots, mushrooms, etc.) and
                    animal-based foods (such as fish, crustaceans, and molluscs).</li>
                <li><strong>Significant Heavy Metals:</strong> Among the most significant heavy metals from the point of
                    view of health are Mercury (Hg), Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Nickel (Ni), and Zinc (Zn). Some
                    intermediate elements such as Arsenic (As) and Aluminium (Al), which are highly relevant from a
                    toxicological point of view, are generally studied together with heavy metals.</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis of Veterinary Drugs and Antibiotics:</strong> Research has indicated that the
                    presence of veterinary medication, antibiotics, and other pharmaceutical residues in food products
                    generated from animals might result in negative health outcomes, such as hormonal imbalances,
                    allergic reactions, and antibiotic resistance. METS Laboratories provides several veterinary drugs &
                    antibiotics components analyses within its global networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Food Colours:</strong> Research shows that artificial food colouring and pigments
                    alter brain neurotransmitters, alter brain structure at the microscopic level, and impact learning,
                    memory, and activity. OEHHA (California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment) has
                    pointed out problems with the FDA’s approvals for these unnecessary colour additives.</li>
                <li><strong>Radioactivity and Radioisotope Analysis:</strong> Nowadays, radioactive contamination of
                    food is a major problem. Eating food tainted with radionuclides during a nuclear or radiological
                    emergency will raise the body's radioactivity levels and may raise the health risks of radiation
                    exposure. Radiation exposure from naturally occurring radioactivity in food and drink accounts for
                    about 10% of this exposure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health
                Organisation (WHO) collectively contributed to the development of international standards relating to
                the control of radioactivity in food and drinking water. Council Regulation No.3954/87 (EURATOM) of 22nd
                December 1987 lays down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of
                feeding kinds of stuff. Two complementary regulations, Regulation No. 944/89 of April 12, 1989, which
                established the maximum allowed levels of radioactive contamination in minor foodstuffs after a nuclear
                accident or other radiological emergency, and Regulation No. 770/90, the Commission Regulation of March
                29, 1990, which established the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of feeding
                materials after a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency, completed Regulation 3954/87.
